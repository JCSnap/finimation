# Duration & Convexity Lab

Bond price sensitivity to yield can be approximated with first- and second-order terms.

## Duration Approximation

For a small yield change $\Delta y$:

$$\frac{\Delta P}{P} \approx -D_{mod}\,\Delta y$$

## Duration + Convexity Approximation

$$\frac{\Delta P}{P} \approx -D_{mod}\,\Delta y + \frac{1}{2}C(\Delta y)^2$$

- **Modified duration** captures linear sensitivity.
- **Convexity** captures curvature and reduces approximation error for larger shocks.

Use the charts to compare approximation quality as yield shocks grow.
