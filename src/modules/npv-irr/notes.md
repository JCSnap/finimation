# NPV Profile & IRR Analyzer

A project is attractive when discounted value of inflows exceeds initial outlay.

## Net Present Value

$$NPV(r) = \sum_{t=0}^{N} \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}$$

- $NPV > 0$: value-creating at discount rate $r$
- $NPV < 0$: value-destroying at $r$

## Internal Rate of Return

The **IRR** solves:

$$NPV(IRR) = 0$$

On the profile chart, IRR is where the NPV curve crosses zero.
