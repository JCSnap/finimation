# Time Value of Money

A dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future — because money can earn a return over time.

## Future Value

$$FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n$$

Where $r$ is the interest rate per period and $n$ is the number of periods.

## Present Value

$$PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n}$$

Discounting brings a future cash flow back to today's value.

## Annuity

An **annuity** is a series of equal payments $C$ over $n$ periods.

$$PV_{\text{annuity}} = C \times \frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r}$$

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Discounting | Converting future value to present value |
| Compounding | Converting present value to future value |
| Discount rate | The rate used to discount future cash flows |
| NPV | Net present value — sum of discounted cash flows |

## Interactive Controls

Adjust the **initial amount**, **interest rate**, and **number of periods** to see how a lump sum grows over time. Switch to **Annuity PV** mode to see the present value of a stream of equal payments.
