# 3-Statement Linkage

A single operating assumption can ripple across all statements.

## Core relationships

- Revenue drives operating profit
- Net income feeds retained earnings
- Non-cash expenses and working capital changes bridge net income to operating cash flow
- Financing cash flow (debt draw/repay) closes the cash minimum constraint

## Simplified formulas

$$CFO = NetIncome + D\&A - \Delta NWC$$

$$CFI = -Capex$$

$$\Delta Cash = CFO + CFI + CFF$$

Accounting identity check each year:

$$Assets = Liabilities + Equity$$
